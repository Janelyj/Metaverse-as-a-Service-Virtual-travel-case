# Metaverse-as-a-Service: Virtual-travel-case
This is a special case (i.e., virtual travel) of Metaverse-as-a-Service, where we compare the quality of experience with different data rates. By evenly allocating rendering capacity to users, we examine the MI under four different data rate conditions with respect to the number of users via simulation experiments. We consider the total rendering capacity of the rendering server is set to 4000 K, where 1 K resolution refers to 960 Ã— 480 pixel resolution. Moreover, there are 56 virtual objects in the virtual travel scenario, where the number of virtual objects for a user is randomly chosen from {1, 2, . . . , 55, 56} and the rendering
capacity of each virtual object is set to 20K.
